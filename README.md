# Risky-Business

Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, I will predict credit risk with machine learning techniques.

## Methods and Techniques Used:
I will use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

1. Resampling: 

We will use the imbalanced learn library to resample the LendingClud data and build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers using the resampled data. 

2. Ensemble Learning: 

In this section, I will train and compare two different ensemble classifiers to predict loan risk and evaluate each model. I will use the Balanced Random Forest Classifier and the Easy Ensemble Classifier.

## Goal Of This Project:

The purpose of this project is to be able to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data one would typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans).
